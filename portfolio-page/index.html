    <h2>About Me</h2>
        <h3>A curious career changer learns to code.</h3>
            <p>Solving problems, analyzing function and working collaboratively are skills I used daily in the analog world in my former career as an occupational therapist. As a newly minted developer I now apply these skills in the digital realm using technologies such as JavaScript, Django, Python, HTML and CSS. My goal is to build amazing stuff that is meaningful, practical and beautiful.</p>
