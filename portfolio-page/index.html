                <p>Solving problems, analyzing function and working collaboratively are skills I used daily in the analog world in my former career as an occupational therapist.</p>
                <p>As a newly minted developer fresh out of a twelve week immersive coding program through Momentum Learning, I now apply these skills in the digital realm using technologies such as JavaScript, Django, Python, HTML and CSS. My goal is to build amazing stuff that is meaningful, practical and beautiful.</p>
                <p>I currently reside in Durham, NC and I am interested in relocating to Seattle, WA. I hike, travel, garden and learn to sail in my free time.</p>

            <h4>Grubbernaut is an app that puts hard to access information into the hands of users in an easy to use and fun format. Grubbernaut takes health inspection score data compiled through three Wake County API's and allows the user to compare the scores to Yelp ratings which are gleaned from a fourth API-- Yelp Fusion API-- in one quick step. Grubbernaut gives a user more decision-making power when choosing where to dine. This app was developed using JavaScript, Django, HTML and CSS. Graphic elements were created using Chart.js. This project was created over the course of two weeks with three classmates at Momentum Learning Immersive Coding Program.</h4>
